Rai, featuring an ensemble cast that includes Akshay Kumar, Dhanush, and Sara Ali Khan. The film tells the story of Rinku Sooryavanshi, played by Khan, who is caught in a complex love triangle between her imaginary boyfriend Sajjad (Kumar) and her real-life husband Vishu (Dhanush). The narrative explores themes of love, trauma, and mental health, particularly highlighting Rinku's struggles stemming from witnessing her parents' honor killing. Despite receiving mixed reviews for its handling of sensitive topics and a convoluted plot, "Atrangi Re" was praised for its music composed by A.R. Rahman and the performances of the lead actors. The film was released on Disney+ Hotstar on December 24, 2021, and sparked discussions about its portrayal of mental illness and the nature of love, with the writer addressing criticisms by emphasizing the film's intent to entertain rather than serve as a documentary on mental health issues.
