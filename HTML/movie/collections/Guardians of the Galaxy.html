The film follows Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, played by Chris Pratt, who steals a mysterious orb and becomes the target of a manhunt led by the villain Ronan the Accuser. To escape, Quill forms an unlikely alliance with a group of misfits, including the deadly Gamora, the vengeful Drax the Destroyer, the genetically modified Rocket Raccoon, and the sentient tree Groot. Together, they must work to stop Ronan from using the orb's power to destroy the galaxy. The film was praised for its humor, visual effects, and engaging soundtrack, featuring classic songs from the 1970s and 1980s, and became a critical and commercial success, grossing over $773 million worldwide. It launched a successful franchise, leading to two sequels, "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" (2017) and "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3" (2023), and solidified its place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
