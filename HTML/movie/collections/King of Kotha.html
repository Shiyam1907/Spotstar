The film follows the story of Raju Madrassi, a feared gangster who returns to his hometown of Kotha after a long absence, leading to a clash with his childhood friend-turned-rival Kannan Bhai. Despite receiving mixed reviews, particularly for its convoluted plot and uneven pacing in the second half, "King of Kotha" was praised for its stylish visuals, engaging first half, and the performances of Dulquer Salmaan, Shabeer Kallarakkal, and Gokul Suresh. The film's soundtrack, composed by Jakes Bejoy and Shaan Rahman, also received acclaim. Although a commercial disappointment, "King of Kotha" showcased Abhilash Joshiy's potential as a director and Dulquer Salmaan's versatility as an actor.
