Starring Brie Larson as Carol Danvers, the film is set in 1995 and follows her transformation from a U.S. Air Force pilot into the powerful superhero Captain Marvel after being exposed to a Kree device that alters her DNA. As she grapples with her fragmented memories and identity, Danvers teams up with a young Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, to thwart a galactic conflict between the Kree and Skrull races. The film received praise for its humor, visual effects, and strong performances, particularly Larson's portrayal of a character embodying resilience and empowerment. With a box office gross exceeding $1.1 billion, "Captain Marvel" became a significant entry in the MCU, paving the way for her role in "Avengers: Endgame" and establishing her as one of the franchise's most formidable heroes.
