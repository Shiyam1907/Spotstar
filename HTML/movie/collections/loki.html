Premiering on Disney+ on June 9, 2021, the series follows Loki, portrayed by Tom Hiddleston, after he escapes with the Tesseract during the events of "Avengers: Endgame," creating an alternate timeline. Captured by the Time Variance Authority (TVA), Loki is forced to help track down a dangerous variant of himself, leading to a journey that explores themes of identity, free will, and redemption. The show features a strong supporting cast, including Owen Wilson and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and has been praised for its innovative storytelling, visual style, and character development. Following the success of its first season, a second season was announced, further expanding the narrative and its implications within the MCU.
