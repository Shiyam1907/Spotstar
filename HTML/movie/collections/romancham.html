The film follows seven bachelors who summon a spirit using an Ouija board, leading to a series of hilarious and eerie events in their shared house. With its relatable characters, organic storytelling, and impeccable comic timing from the ensemble cast, "Romancham" has been praised as one of the best horror-comedies in Malayalam cinema. The film's success lies in its ability to blend situational humor arising from the characters' spontaneous reactions with an underlying eerie atmosphere, making it a laugh riot from start to finish. The director's debut effort has been a box office hit, with the film's soundtrack by Sushin Shyam and the promising performances of actors like Soubin Shahir and Arjun Ashokan contributing to its popularity.
