The film serves as a spiritual successor to the 1986 film of the same name and is set within the Lokesh Cinematic Universe. The plot follows Vikram, a former commander of a black-ops team, as he investigates a series of murders linked to a mysterious gang of masked men and a powerful drug lord named Sandhanam. The film is noted for its intense action sequences, engaging storyline, and strong performances, particularly by Haasan and Sethupathi. Released on June 3, 2022, "Vikram" received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of the year, with a box office collection of approximately â‚¹500 crore. The film's success has further solidified Kamal Haasan's status as a leading figure in Indian cinema and has set the stage for potential sequels in the franchise.
