The story revolves around two soon-to-be brothers-in-law, Anandan (Prithviraj) and Vinu (Basil), who find themselves in a comedic rivalry as they navigate the complexities surrounding Vinu's impending marriage to Anandan's sister, Anjali. The film explores themes of friendship and rivalry, showcasing the humorous bond that develops between the two men as they challenge each other amidst wedding chaos. Despite its engaging first half, the film has received mixed reviews for its pacing and character development, particularly in the second half, where it leans into slapstick humor. However, the chemistry between Prithviraj and Basil has been praised, along with the film's light-hearted approach to the chaos of Indian weddings, making it an entertaining watch for fans of the genre.
