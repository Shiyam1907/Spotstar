The story follows Aladdin, a resourceful street urchin living in the fictional city of Agrabah, who discovers a magical lamp containing a genie, voiced by Robin Williams. With the genie's help, Aladdin transforms into Prince Ali to win the heart of Princess Jasmine, but he must also contend with the evil sorcerer Jafar, who seeks the lamp for his own nefarious purposes. The film is celebrated for its vibrant animation, memorable characters, and catchy songs, including the Academy Award-winning "A Whole New World." While it achieved commercial success and critical acclaim, it has also faced criticism for its portrayal of Arab culture and stereotypes, leading Disney to add content warnings in later releases. "Aladdin" remains a beloved classic, spawning a successful Broadway adaptation and a live-action remake in 2019, further cementing its place in popular culture.
