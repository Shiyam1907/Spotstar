The film follows a group of immortal alien beings known as the Eternals, who emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their ancient adversaries, the Deviants. Featuring an ensemble cast that includes Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Angelina Jolie, and Salma Hayek, "Eternals" explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the moral dilemmas faced by these godlike beings as they grapple with their purpose and the consequences of their long-standing detachment from humanity. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for its ambitious storytelling and visual effects but criticism for its complex narrative and pacing. Despite this, it grossed over $402 million worldwide, contributing to the ongoing expansion of the MCU and introducing new characters and cosmic elements to the franchise.
