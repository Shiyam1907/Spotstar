The series revolves around Nagendran, a lazy man who concocts a scheme to marry multiple women to secure dowries, aiming to fund his dream of moving to Kuwait. Set in the late 1970s, the narrative unfolds across various locations in Kerala, showcasing Nagendran's escapades and the flawed characters of the women he marries, each with their own vulnerabilities. While the series begins with engaging humor and relatable moments, it ultimately becomes repetitive and oversimplifies the serious issue of marriage fraud, failing to adequately address the consequences of Nagendran's actions. Despite its shortcomings in storytelling, the performances of the cast, particularly Venjaramoodu and Prasanth Alexander, stand out, alongside commendable production design that captures the period's essence. The show is currently available for streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.
