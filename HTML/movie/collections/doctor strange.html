The story follows Dr. Stephen Strange, portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch, as he navigates the complexities of the multiverse after encountering America Chavez, a teenage girl with the ability to travel between dimensions. The plot thickens when Wanda Maximoff, played by Elizabeth Olsen, becomes an antagonist, driven by her desire to reunite with her children from an alternate reality. The film features a blend of horror elements and action, showcasing visually stunning sequences as Strange and Chavez confront various threats across multiple universes. Despite receiving mixed reviews regarding its narrative coherence and character development, the film was praised for its ambitious scope, Raimi's unique directorial style, and its exploration of themes like grief and sacrifice, ultimately grossing over $955 million worldwide.
