The film follows Mowgli, a young boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle, as he embarks on a journey of self-discovery while evading the menacing tiger Shere Khan. Neel Sethi stars as Mowgli, with voice performances from an ensemble cast including Bill Murray as Baloo, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, and Idris Elba as Shere Khan. Combining stunning visual effects with a blend of adventure and heartwarming moments, the film balances elements from both Disney's original animated feature and Kipling's stories. Released on April 15, 2016, it became a commercial success, grossing nearly $966 million worldwide and receiving critical acclaim for its visual effects, storytelling, and performances, ultimately winning several awards for its achievements in visual effects and cinematography.
