The story follows three college students in Bengaluru - Aju, Shanthan, and Bibi - who seek revenge on their bullies by befriending Rangan, leading to a series of hilarious and absurd situations. Faasil's uninhibited portrayal of Rangan, with his love for dance reels and quirky mannerisms, is the driving force of the film, complemented by the impressive debuts of Hipster, Mithun Jai Shankar, and Roshan Shanavas as the trio. While the film's humor and entertainment value are praised, some critics argue that it glorifies excessive alcohol consumption and smoking. However, the film's supporters counter that it effectively balances the comedic elements with a cautionary tale about the consequences of delving into the world of gangsters. "Aavesham" has emerged as a box office success and a showcase for Fahadh Faasil's versatility as an actor.
