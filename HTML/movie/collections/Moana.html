Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, the film follows Moana's journey as she sets sail in search of the legendary demigod Maui, voiced by Dwayne Johnson, to help her on her quest. Along the way, Moana discovers her true calling as a wayfinder and leader, overcoming obstacles and forming a strong bond with Maui. The film was praised for its stunning visuals, catchy music, and portrayal of Moana as a strong, independent heroine who embarks on a journey of self-discovery. With a box office gross of over $690 million, "Moana" became a critical and commercial success, cementing its place as a beloved Disney classic.
